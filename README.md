this is part of what I did for learning CSS: followed the [step-by-step video tutorial](https://youtu.be/zxfhf-V4JFQ)

Here is a [working demo](https://mpalitto.github.io/CSS-product-rotating-features/)

Here is what I learned:

## CSS flexbox
The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

and a couple of CSS tricks

1. center an element vertically on the page
2. divide a squared element into 4 equal slices

NOTE: The Javascript code did not work for me as shown in the video, I made it work with some changes...
